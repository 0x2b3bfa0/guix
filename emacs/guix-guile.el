;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides functions for parsing guile code, making guile
;; expressions, etc.

;;; Code:

(defun guix-guile-make-call-expression (proc &rest args)
  "Return \"(PROC ARGS ...)\" string.
PROC and ARGS should be strings."
  (format "(%s %s)"
          proc
          (mapconcat #'identity args " ")))

(defun guix-make-guile-expression (fun &rest args)
  "Return string containing a guile expression for calling FUN with ARGS."
  (format "(%S %s)" fun
          (mapconcat
           (lambda (arg)
             (cond
              ((null arg) "'()")
              ((or (eq arg t)
                   ;; An ugly hack to separate 'false' from nil.
                   (equal arg 'f)
                   (keywordp arg))
