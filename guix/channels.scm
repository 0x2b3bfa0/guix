;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This module implements "channels."  A channel is usually a source of
;;; package definitions.  There's a special channel, the 'guix' channel, that
;;; provides all of Guix, including its commands and its documentation.
;;; User-defined channels are expected to typically provide a bunch of .scm
;;; files meant to be added to the '%package-search-path'.
;;;
;;; This module provides tools to fetch and update channels from a Git
;;; repository and to build them.
;;;
