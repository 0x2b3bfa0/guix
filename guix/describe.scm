;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This module provides supporting code to allow a Guix instance to find, at
;;; run time, which profile it's in (profiles created by 'guix pull').  That
;;; allows it to read meta-information about itself (e.g., repository URL and
;;; commit ID) and to find other channels available in the same profile.  It's
;;; a bit like ELPA's pkg-info.el.
;;;
;;; Code:
