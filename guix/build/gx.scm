;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This is the build-side support code of (guix gx-download).  It allows a
;;; gx hash to be fetched.
;;;
;;; Code:

(define* (gx-fetch hash directory
                   #:key (gx-command "gx"))
  "Fetch IPFS HASH into DIRECTORY.  HASH must be a valid IPFS hash.
Return #t on success, #f otherwise."

  (mkdir-p directory)

  (with-directory-excursion directory
    ;; TODO: Silence verbose output.

    ;; Initialization is interactive, but we can shut it up by piping it to
    ;; nothing.
    (let ((port (open-pipe* OPEN_WRITE gx-command "init")))
      (display "\n" port)
      (if (not (eqv? 0 (status:exit-val (close-pipe port))))
          (error "Cannot initialize gx package")))

    ;; Fetch to the "vendor" directory.
    (let ((port (open-pipe* OPEN_WRITE gx-command "import" "--local" hash)))
      (display "N\n" port)
      (if (not (eqv? 0 (status:exit-val (close-pipe port))))
          (error "Cannot import gx package")))
