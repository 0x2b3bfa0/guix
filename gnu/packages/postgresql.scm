   (description
    "PostgreSQL is a powerful object-relational database system.  It is fully
ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and
stored procedures (in multiple languages).  It includes most SQL:2008 data
types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and
TIMESTAMP.  It also supports storage of binary large objects, including
pictures, sounds, or video.")
