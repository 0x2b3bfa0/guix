    (description
     "GNU Smalltalk is a free implementation of the Smalltalk-80 language.

In the Smalltalk language, everything is an object.  This includes numbers,
executable procedures (methods), stack frames (called method contexts or block
contexts), etc.  Each object is an \"instance\" of a \"class\".  A class can
be thought of as a datatype and the set of functions that operate on that
datatype.  An instance is a particular variable of that datatype.  When you
want to perform an operation on an object, you send it a \"message\", and the
object performs an operation that corresponds to that message.")
