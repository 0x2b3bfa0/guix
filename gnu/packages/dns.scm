    (description
     "Dnsmasq is a lightweight DNS forwarder and DHCP server.  It is designed
to provide DNS and optionally, DHCP, to a small network.  It can serve the
names of local machines which are not in the global DNS.  The DHCP server
integrates with the DNS server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated
addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured either in each host or in
a central configuration file.  Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic DHCP leases
and BOOTP/TFTP for network booting of diskless machines.")
