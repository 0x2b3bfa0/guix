   (synopsis "Conversion between thousands of scales")
   (description
    "GNU Units converts quantities expressed in various systems of
measurement to their equivalents in other systems of measurement.  Like
many similar programs, it can handle multiplicative scale changes.  It can
also handle nonlinear conversions such as Fahrenheit to Celsius or wire
gauge, and it can convert from and to sums of units, such as converting
between meters and feet plus inches.

Beyond simple unit conversions, GNU Units can be used as a general-purpose
scientific calculator that keeps track of units in its calculations.  You
can form arbitrary complex mathematical expressions of dimensions including
sums, products, quotients, powers, and even roots of dimensions.  Thus you
can ensure accuracy and dimensional consistency when working with long
expressions that involve many different units that may combine in complex
ways.

The units are defined in an external data file.  You can use the extensive
data file that comes with this program, or you can provide your own data
file to suit your needs.  You can also use your own data file to supplement
the standard data file.")
