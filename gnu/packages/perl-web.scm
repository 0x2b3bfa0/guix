    (description "Back in the early days of the web, many people learned Perl
because of a wonderful Perl library called @code{CGI}.  It was simple enough
to get started without knowing much about the language and powerful enough to
keep you going, learning by doing was much fun.  While most of the techniques
used are outdated now, the idea behind it is not.  Mojolicious is a new
endeavor to implement this idea using modern technologies.")
