    (description
     "JACK is a low-latency audio server.  It can connect a number of
different applications to an audio device, as well as allowing them to share
audio between themselves.  JACK is different from other audio server efforts
in that it has been designed from the ground up to be suitable for
professional audio work.  This means that it focuses on two key areas:
synchronous execution of all clients, and low latency operation.")
