    (description
     "GD is a library for the dynamic creation of images by programmers.  GD
is written in C, and \"wrappers\" are available for Perl, PHP and other
languages.  GD creates PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, XPM, BMP images, among other
formats.  GD is commonly used to generate charts, graphics, thumbnails, and
most anything else, on the fly.  While not restricted to use on the web, the
most common applications of GD involve website development.")
