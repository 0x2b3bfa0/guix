    (description
     "The library provides a sort of useful classes, algorithms, and
high-level protocols to support an application programmer in writing such
software.  The most remarkable feature is the absence of a trusted third
party (TTP), i.e. neither a central game server nor trusted hardware
components are necessary.

The corresponding cryptographic problem, actually called Mental Poker, has
been studied since 1979 (Shamir, Rivest, and Adleman) by many authors.
LibTMCG provides the first practical implementation of such protocols.")
