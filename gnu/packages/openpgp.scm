    (description
     "The library provides a sort of useful classes, algorithms, and
high-level protocols to support an application programmer in writing such
software.  The most remarkable feature is the absence of a trusted third
party (TTP), i.e. neither a central game server nor trusted hardware
components are necessary.

The corresponding cryptographic problem, actually called Mental Poker, has
been studied since 1979 (Shamir, Rivest, and Adleman) by many authors.
LibTMCG provides the first practical implementation of such protocols.")

    (description
     "The Distributed Privacy Guard (DKGPG) implements Distributed Key
Generation (DKG) and Threshold Cryptography for OpenPGP.  The generated public
keys are compatible with the standard and thus can be used by any
RFC4880-compliant application (e.g. GnuPG).  The main purposes of this
software are distributing power among multiple parties, eliminating single
points of failure, and increasing the difficulty of side-channel attacks on
private key material.

DKGPG consists of a bunch of simple command-line programs.  The current
implementation is in experimental state and should NOT be used in production
environments.")
