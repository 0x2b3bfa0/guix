false positives (TPPFP), and false discovery rate (FDR).  Several choices
of bootstrap-based null distribution are implemented (centered, centered
and scaled, quantile-transformed).  Single-step and step-wise methods are
available.  Tests based on a variety of T- and F-statistics (including
T-statistics based on regression parameters from linear and survival models
as well as those based on correlation parameters) are included.  When probing
hypotheses with T-statistics, users may also select a potentially faster null
distribution which is multivariate normal with mean zero and variance
covariance matrix derived from the vector influence function.  Results are
reported in terms of adjusted P-values, confidence regions and test statistic
cutoffs.  The procedures are directly applicable to identifying differentially
expressed genes in DNA microarray experiments.")
