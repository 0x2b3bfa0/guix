   (description
    "Unclutter is a program which runs permanently in the background of an
X11 session.  It checks on the X11 pointer (cursor) position every few
seconds, and when it finds it has not moved (and no buttons are pressed
on the mouse, and the cursor is not in the root window) it creates a
small sub-window as a child of the window the cursor is in.  The new
window installs a cursor of size 1x1 but a mask of all 0, i.e. an
invisible cursor.  This allows you to see all the text in an xterm or
xedit, for example.  The human factors crowd would agree it should make
things less distracting.")
