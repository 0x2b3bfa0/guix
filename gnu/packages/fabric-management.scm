OpenSM is the OpenIB project's Subnet Manager for Infiniband networks.
The subnet manager is run as a system daemon on one of the machines in
the infiniband fabric to manage the fabric's routing state.  This package
also contains various tools for diagnosing and testing Infiniband networks
that can be used from any machine and do not need to be run on a machine
running the opensm daemon.")
