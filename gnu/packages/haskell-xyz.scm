    (description "This Haskell library offers (among other things) the
following selection of synchronisation primitives:

@itemize
@item @code{Broadcast}: Wake multiple threads by broadcasting a value.
@item @code{Event}: Wake multiple threads by signalling an event.
@item @code{Lock}: Enforce exclusive access to a resource.  Also known
as a binary semaphore or mutex.  The package additionally provides an
alternative that works in the STM monad.
@item @code{RLock}: A lock which can be acquired multiple times by the
same thread.  Also known as a reentrant mutex.
@item @code{ReadWriteLock}: Multiple-reader, single-writer locks.  Used
to protect shared resources which may be concurrently read, but only
sequentially written.
@item @code{ReadWriteVar}: Concurrent read, sequential write variables.
@end itemize

Please consult the API documentation of the individual modules for more
detailed information.

This package was inspired by the concurrency libraries of Java and
Python.")
