    (description
     "sxiv is an alternative to feh and qiv.  Its primary goal is to
provide the most basic features required for fast image viewing.  It has
vi key bindings and works nicely with tiling window managers.  Its code
base should be kept small and clean to make it easy for you to dig into
it and customize it for your needs.")
