    (description
     "NASM, the Netwide Assembler, is an 80x86 and x86-64 assembler designed
for portability and modularity.  It supports a range of object file formats,
including Linux and *BSD a.out, ELF, COFF, Mach-O, Microsoft 16-bit OBJ,
Windows32 and Windows64.  It will also output plain binary files.  Its syntax
is designed to be simple and easy to understand, similar to Intel's but less
complex.  It supports all currently known x86 architectural extensions, and
has strong support for macros.")
