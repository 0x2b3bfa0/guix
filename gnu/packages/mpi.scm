     "The Open MPI Project is an MPI-2 implementation that is developed and
maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners.  Open
MPI is therefore able to combine the expertise, technologies, and resources
from all across the High Performance Computing community in order to build the
best MPI library available.  Open MPI offers advantages for system and
software vendors, application developers and computer science researchers.")
