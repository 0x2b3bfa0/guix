contents of font files. It provides a uniform interface to access font files.
It supports both bitmap and scalable formats, including TrueType, OpenType,
Type1, CID, CFF, Windows FON/FNT, X11 PCF, and others. It supports high-speed
anti-aliased glyph bitmap generation with 256 gray levels.")

   (description
    "T1lib is a library for generating/rasterising bitmaps from Type 1 fonts.
It is based on the code of the X11 rasteriser of the X11 project.

The bitmaps created by t1lib are returned in a data structure with type
GLYPH. This special GLYPH-type is also used in the X11 window system to
describe character bitmaps. It contains the bitmap data as well as some
metric information. But t1lib is in itself entirely independent of the
X11-system or any other graphical user interface. ")
