    "Freetype is a library that can be used by applications to access the
contents of font files. It provides a uniform interface to access font files.
It supports both bitmap and scalable formats, including TrueType, OpenType,
Type1, CID, CFF, Windows FON/FNT, X11 PCF, and others. It supports high-speed
anti-aliased glyph bitmap generation with 256 gray levels.")

    "Fontconfig can discover new fonts when installed automatically;
perform font name substitution, so that appropriate alternative fonts can
be selected if fonts are missing;
identify the set of fonts required to completely cover a set of languages;
have GUI configuration tools built as it uses an XML-based configuration file;
efficiently and quickly find needed fonts among the set of installed fonts;
be used in concert with the X Render Extension and FreeType to implement
high quality, anti-aliased and subpixel rendered text on a display.")
