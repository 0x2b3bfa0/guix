    (description
      "C-ares is a C library that performs DNS requests and name resolution
asynchronously.  It is intended for applications which need to perform DNS
queries without blocking, or need to perform multiple DNS queries in parallel.
The primary examples of such applications are servers which communicate with
multiple clients and programs with graphical user interfaces.")
