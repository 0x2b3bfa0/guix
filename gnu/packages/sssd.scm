    (description
     "DING-LIBS (DING Is Not Glib) are a set of small, useful libraries that
the @dfn{System Security Services Daemon} (SSSD) uses and makes available to
other projects.  They include: libdhash, an implementation of a dynamic hash
table which will dynamically resize to achieve optimal storage and access time
properties; ini_config, a library for parsing and managing @code{INI} files;
path_utils, a library to manage UNIX paths and subsets of paths; collection, a
generic, hierarchical grouping mechanism for complex data sets; ref_array, a
dynamically-growing, reference-counted array; libbasicobjects, a set of
fundamental object types for C.")
