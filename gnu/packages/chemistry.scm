    (description "DomainFinder is an interactive program for the determination
and characterization of dynamical domains in proteins.  It can infer dynamical
domains by comparing two protein structures, or from normal mode analysis on a
single structure.  The software is currently not actively maintained and works
only with Python 2 and NumPy < 1.9.")
