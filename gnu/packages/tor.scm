     "Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed
network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents
somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you
visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical
location.  Tor works with many of your existing applications, including
web browsers, instant messaging clients, remote login, and other
applications based on the TCP protocol.

To @code{torify} applications (to take measures to ensure that an application,
which has not been designed for use with Tor such as ssh, will use only Tor for
internet connectivity, and also ensures that there are no leaks from DNS, UDP or
the application layer) you need to install @code{torsocks}.")
