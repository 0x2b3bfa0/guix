    "Many computer users need to manipulate text files: extract and then
operate on data from parts of certain lines while discarding the rest, make
changes in various text files wherever certain patterns appear, and so on.
To write a program to do these things in a language such as C or Pascal is a
time-consuming inconvenience that may take many lines of code.  The job is
easy with awk, especially the GNU implementation: Gawk.

The awk utility interprets a special-purpose programming language that makes
it possible to handle many data-reformatting jobs with just a few lines of

Computer users often find occasion to ask how two files differ. Perhaps one
file is a newer version of the other file. Or maybe the two files started out
as identical copies but were changed by different people.

You can use the diff command to show differences between two files, or each
corresponding file in two directories. diff outputs differences between files
line by line in any of several formats, selectable by command line
options. This set of differences is often called a ‚Äòdiff‚Äô or ‚Äòpatch‚Äô. For
files that are identical, diff normally produces no output; for
binary (non-text) files, diff normally reports only that they are different.

You can use the cmp command to show the offsets and line numbers where two
files differ. cmp can also show all the characters that differ between the
two files, side by side.

You can use the diff3 command to show differences among three files. When two
people have made independent changes to a common original, diff3 can report
the differences between the original and the two changed versions, and can
produce a merged file that contains both persons' changes together with
warnings about conflicts.

You can use the sdiff command to merge two files interactively.")

   (description "GMP, the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library")
   (long-description
    "GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on
signed integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers.  There is no
practical limit to the precision except the ones implied by the available
memory in the machine GMP runs on.  GMP has a rich set of functions, and the
functions have a regular interface.

The main target applications for GMP are cryptography applications and
research, Internet security applications, algebra systems, computational
algebra research, etc.

GMP is carefully designed to be as fast as possible, both for small operands
and for huge operands.  The speed is achieved by using fullwords as the basic
arithmetic type, by using fast algorithms, with highly optimised assembly
code for the most common inner loops for a lot of CPUs, and by a general
emphasis on speed.

GMP is faster than any other bignum library.  The advantage for GMP increases
with the operand sizes for many operations, since GMP uses asymptotically
faster algorithms.")

"The Lout document formatting system is now reads a high-level description of
a document similar in style to LaTeX and produces a PostScript or plain text
output file.

Lout offers an unprecedented range of advanced features, including optimal
paragraph and page breaking, automatic hyphenation, PostScript EPS file
inclusion and generation, equation formatting, tables, diagrams, rotation and
scaling, sorted indexes, bibliographic databases, running headers and
odd-even pages, automatic cross referencing, multilingual documents including
hyphenation (most European languages are supported), formatting of computer
programs, and much more, all ready to use.  Furthermore, Lout is easily
extended with definitions which are very much easier to write than troff of
TeX macros because Lout is a high-level, purely functional language, the
outcome of an eight-year research project that went back to the
beginning.")
