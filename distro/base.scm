   (long-description
"GNU libsigsegv is a library for handling page faults in user mode. A page
fault occurs when a program tries to access to a region of memory that is
currently not available. Catching and handling a page fault is a useful
technique for implementing pageable virtual memory, memory-mapped access to
persistent databases, generational garbage collectors, stack overflow
handlers, distributed shared memory, and more.")

   (description "GNU implementation of the Awk programming language")
   (long-description
    "Many computer users need to manipulate text files: extract and then
operate on data from parts of certain lines while discarding the rest, make
changes in various text files wherever certain patterns appear, and so on.
To write a program to do these things in a language such as C or Pascal is a
time-consuming inconvenience that may take many lines of code.  The job is
easy with awk, especially the GNU implementation: Gawk.

The awk utility interprets a special-purpose programming language that makes
it possible to handle many data-reformatting jobs with just a few lines of
code.")
