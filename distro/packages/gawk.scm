   (synopsis "GNU implementation of the Awk programming language")
   (description
    "Many computer users need to manipulate text files: extract and then
operate on data from parts of certain lines while discarding the rest, make
changes in various text files wherever certain patterns appear, and so on.
To write a program to do these things in a language such as C or Pascal is a
time-consuming inconvenience that may take many lines of code.  The job is
easy with awk, especially the GNU implementation: Gawk.

The awk utility interprets a special-purpose programming language that makes
it possible to handle many data-reformatting jobs with just a few lines of
code.")
