    (description
     " GNU Shishi is an implementation of the Kerberos 5 network
  authentication system, as specified in RFC 4120.  Shishi can be
  used to authenticate users in distributed systems.

  Shishi contains a library (`libshishi') that can be used by
  application developers to add support for Kerberos 5.  Shishi
  contains a command line utility (1shishi') that is used by
  users to acquire and manage tickets (and more).  The server
  side, a Key Distribution Center, is implemented by `shishid'.
