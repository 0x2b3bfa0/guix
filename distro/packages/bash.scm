     (description
      "Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, that will appear in
the GNU operating system.  Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates
useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).  It is intended
to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard.  It
offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive
use.  In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without
modification.")
