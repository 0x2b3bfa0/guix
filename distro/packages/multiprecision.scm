   (synopsis "GMP, the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library")
   (description
    "GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on
signed integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers.  There is no
practical limit to the precision except the ones implied by the available
memory in the machine GMP runs on.  GMP has a rich set of functions, and the
functions have a regular interface.

The main target applications for GMP are cryptography applications and
research, Internet security applications, algebra systems, computational
algebra research, etc.

GMP is carefully designed to be as fast as possible, both for small operands
and for huge operands.  The speed is achieved by using fullwords as the basic
arithmetic type, by using fast algorithms, with highly optimised assembly
code for the most common inner loops for a lot of CPUs, and by a general
emphasis on speed.

GMP is faster than any other bignum library.  The advantage for GMP increases
with the operand sizes for many operations, since GMP uses asymptotically
faster algorithms.")

arithmetic")
   (description
    "The GNU MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision
floating-point computations with correct rounding.  MPFR is based on the GMP
multiple-precision library.

The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision
floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a well-defined
semantics.  It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for
double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).")
