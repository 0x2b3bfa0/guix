    (synopsis
     "GNU gperf, a perfect hash function generator")
    (description
     "GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator.  For a given
list of strings, it produces a hash function and hash table, in
form of C or C++ code, for looking up a value depending on the
input string.  The hash function is perfect, which means that
the hash table has no collisions, and the hash table lookup
needs a single string comparison only.

GNU gperf is highly customizable.  There are options for
generating C or C++ code, for emitting switch statements or
nested ifs instead of a hash table, and for tuning the algorithm
employed by gperf.")
